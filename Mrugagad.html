            <p id="boxonecontentm">Mrugagad is one of the nearest treks from Mumbai and also it's not that well known,
                so
                people visiting this fort are less in number and that gives us the advantage to visit this historic fort
                even during the weekends. But still try to avoid weekends for a peace of mind here. The route up to the
                base of the fort is very easy but the roads are not well built. Simply type Mrugagad fort on your google
                maps and you can reach the base of this fort in a few hours.</p>

            <p id="boxthreecontent">The start and end roads of this trekking route for bikes up to the base
                are very good. Once you reach the base you can park your vehicles, there is enough parking space
                available in the base
                village. When we left the base for our trek we had already told one of the villagers to prepare our
                lunch for that afternoon. The cost of non veg lunch is around 150 Rs. only and it's also a type of
                income for the villagers so try to help them. The start of the trek is from the white railings and the
                climb is not that difficult, all the boards directing you towards the fort are visible.

            <p id="boxfivecontentm">The 1st patch is only walking through the woods for half an hour and then you start
                gaining some elevation. Eventually you will reach a deep cut between the rocks where a rope is there for
                our help, use the rope and climb this cut very carefully. Since this is not a long trek once you cross
                this cut you would have completed half of this trek already. The view of the hills in front of you is so
                wonderful.</p>

                stairs which take you to the top of the fort. When we visited this fort, there were volunteers trying to
                keep this fort clean and well maintained. The top part is actually vast and you have to move forward
                until you reach the flag and the water tanks. This is where our trek ends, a group had accompanied us in
                this trek and they were taking drone shots from the top.</p>

                While descending the route is the same, if the rain does not hit your return path then you can take a
                riskier path which leads you to the caves of this fort. But the route is actually very risky and be very
                careful when you attempt this path to the caves. Still the view from the caves is worth the risk.

                We returned to the base, had our lunch in the villager uncles house and then left for a historic place
                called Umberkhind which was in our return route for home. The history of this place is worth reading and
                if you like to read about wars and Maratha history, it's one of the places you should visit.
