        <p id="titleALL">Monsoon Trek To Gorakhgad</p>

        <div class="boxoneg">
            <p id="boxonecontentg">Gorakhgad is one of the best forts to visit in monsoon as the surrounding area and
                the way up is full of
                greenery. It is located around 24km from Murbad, if you simply put the location as Gorakhgad fort on
                Google Maps it will take you up to the base of the fort where you can park your vehicle. Some locals
                will ask you to pay for the parking but don't pay more than 70 Rs. Here at the steps of the temple our
                trek begins.
                If possible avoid trekking during weekends as in monsoon there are more than 100 people here and you
                will not find the peace and enjoyment you are looking for. The trek starts from behind the temple and
                the starting part is not that hard, it has plain muddy roads with no elevation. You can complete this
                part very swiftly, as the further parts are difficult and you will need enough stamina so don't waste
                much time here.
                After crossing this muddy patch, you will experience the best walk through nature. The trees are well
                grown, the greenery of the grass, the chirping of the birds and what not, you will really enjoy this
                path so take your time and cross it as the next part is where the actual climb begins and it is
                different from these patches as this is going to be a steep climb.
            </p>

            <p id="boxtwocontentg">The steep climbing patch could be climbed in half an hour and after crossing this
                patch the fort will be
                visible. If you are lucky enough to not encounter rain till now you can treat your eyes with the next
                spot that comes after this half hour climb. All your tiredness and fatigue of climbing will vanish as
                this place has so much wind speed and the view from here is so pleasing.

            <p id="boxthreecontentg">The path ahead is quite simple but it's still possible that you can take a
                different turn and lose the way, which happened with us but I had a gpx file of the fort which helped us
                a lot. In another half hour you'll reach the patch where there is a small mandir and boards which gives
                you information about the Gorakhgad fort. This whole route up until now can be considered as the 1st
                patch and there are more than 2 patches to complete this trek.

            <p id="boxfivecontentg">The 2nd patch consists of stairs which lead you up to the main Darwaja, this whole
                patch consists of stairs and it is quite easy as there is enough space to find grip and reach the
                darwaja. Then if you continue on the same path you'll reach the caves of the Gorakhgad fort. You can
                have some rest here, eat some snacks and get ready for the final patch of this trek.

                gaining
                elevation as it is very steep. It has steep stairs and some man made holes to provide grip to your
                fingers while climbing. In total you will take around 3 hours to complete reaching the top. </p>

                The top of the fort has another small temple and the view is very good. We sat here for 1 hour, had our
                lunch and then started to descend in the rain.
                We started descending and the rain struck us, so we were cautious while coming down as it was the
                hardest patch of the trek and we took our time, but after some time the rain stopped and there was
                enough afternoon sun that we accelerated our descent. We reached the base, checked our car and then
                headed home. We started this trek around 8:30 am and completed it by 2pm. You can complete it even
                faster if you are not taking that much breaks and photographs.
