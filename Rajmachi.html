            <p id="titleALL">Rajmachi Trek From Kondhane Route</p>
            <p id="boxonecontent">This is one of the longest treks in Maharashtra and also one of the toughest. There
                are 2 ways to reach Rajmachi, one is from the Lonavala route and that is the easiest way as it takes you directly up to the
                base village. But the way from the Karjat side that takes you from the Kondane caves is the toughest, it
                takes you from the plateaus to the forests up to the base village, it spans around 20 kms of trek.
                Reaching the base is not that hard, we had a four wheeler and google maps takes you up to the Kondane
                caves parking so park your car and the trek starts.</p>

            <p id="boxthreecontent">Starting trek from the Kondhane route you will encounter a right turn, please take
                this turn. We ourselves missed this and had to go in circles in the forest before reaching the correct
                path. If
                possible download offline maps as the route consists of many fast flowing streams and the route
                overflows during the monsoons. In the 1st half hour you will reach the Kondane caves, now the actual
                trek starts and the Rajmachi forts are now around 18 kms from here so prepare yourself.</p>

            <p id="boxfivecontent">You will reach a plateau region in 5 minutes from the Kondane caves and then the
                hardest part is forest trekking. You will have to climb continuously for hours and that too on the
                slippery routes to reach another plateau where you can have some rest and refreshments. Carry your own
                lunch as this route does not have many stalls in the way. You will find many such places where you will
                see the wonderful hills of the Sahyadris, this route takes you from Karjat to Lonavala and completing it
                is an achievement in itself.

        <div class="boxsix">
            <p id="boxsixcontent">So finally after trekking for around 15kms you will reach the base village that is the
                Udhewadi village.
                There are many houses here and you will find many shops to eat or drink something, after completing the
                trek till here have a nice break of half hour and then start the trek to the forts that make Rajmachi,
                one is the Shrivardhan fort and another is the Manaranjan fort.

                Shrivardhan fort and on the left is the Manaranjan fort. Start your trek towards the Shrivardhan fort as
                it is more difficult compared to the other. You will require another 2 hours to reach the top of the
                Shrivardhan fort but the view from the top is very good. We could not see much due to the fog and also
                the monkeys did not allow us to stay at the top for a lot of time.</p>

                some rest there failed. We got lost on our return route due to many flowing streams in the path. Now we
                had no choice but to use our offline maps in this heavy rain, it saved us and took us up to the parking
                area. All in all it was a good trek. Just be careful and have enough stamina to complete
                this trek.</p>
